# Automating-LinkedIn-Messaging

The script firstminus.py will login using your credentials, then it loads your webpage of connections.
By default it will message the first connection, which are sorted in an alphabetical order.

Feel free to change the index of "message_buttons", or to add for loop in case you want to text multiple people.
Change the sleep time according to your internet speed.
